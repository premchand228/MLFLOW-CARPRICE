# MLFLOW-LASSO and RIDGE regression  experiments tracking:

* In this project you will understand how we can use MLFLOW and log various metrics.

* We will conduct the data analysis and draw various infrenses that are needed. 

* We will compare the performance of the model using MLFLOW  comparsion GUI.

* This experimrnt is going to be a more advanced than the simple demo we saw earlier(AIOPS-MLFLOW)


## commands used -

### for getting user interface

```bash
mlflow ui
```

### This code can be easily run from anywhere with simple command as below 
* The advantage is that you dont need to download the code into local machine or no need to change any code snippets.
* Experiments can be run easily without any need.

```bash
 mlflow run https://github.com/premchand228/MLFLOW-LASSO-experiment-tracking.git
```


### Comparing diffrent experiments and identifying the accurate parameters and metrics.
